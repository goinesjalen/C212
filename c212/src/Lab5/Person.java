/**
 * In this part of the lab you will use your newfound debugging skills to fix this program that won't seem to run.
 * The class below, Person, is a class that contains a few common methods such as getters and setters and a couple of
 * others.
 *
 * At the bottom of this file, you will see another class called PersonMain. This class only has two methods: a main
 * method and a helper function (see the method itself for details). The main method does not contain any errors,
 * and its sole purpose is to be able to see if the program can run without issues.
 *
 * The only place that is exempt from bugs is the main method at the bottom of this file.
 * You might find bugs anywhere else in the code.
