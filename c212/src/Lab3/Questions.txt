Answer the following questions as comments below your class file or submit a text file:

a. Give the type and value for each of the following expressions:

i. 7.8 == 78 
Boolean, false

ii. 2.3+5*7.01
Double, 37.35

iii. N*4 (treat C as character or ‘N’)
Integer, 440

iv. 9+8+”21”
String, "1721"

b. Without compiling/running the code or looking at any documentation, predict the
value printed by each of the following code fragments. Now compile/run (you may
have to write that in your main method) and see if your answer was correct. Report
the output and whether you were initially correct. If incorrect, explain in one
sentence what was the error you missed:

i. See the following separate code fragments (assume a main if not present):
public class Main {
public static void main (String[] args) {
double num = 9.78;
int newNum = (int) num;
String newStr = String.valueOf(newNum);
System.out.println(num);
System.out.println(newNum);
System.out.println(newStr);
System.out.println(num+newNum);
}
}
System.out.println(newStr+num);
9.78
9
9
18.78
I was correct.

ii. System.out.printf(“%03d”,7);
"007"
I was correct.


iii. String s = “Bye ByeBye”;
s = String.replace(‘y’, ‘e’);
System.out.println(s);
"Bee ByeBye"
I was correct.

c. How are Strings immutable in Java? Explain in a few sentences. What alternatives do you
have for manipulating Strings?
Strings are immutable because we cannot changed a string itself, only its refernce;
for example we cannot concat to a string without first declaring a new refence to that
newly created string.
